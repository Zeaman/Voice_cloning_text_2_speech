# Voice_cloning_text_2_speech
Build speech synthesis model using BARK, Tortoise, and SVC pre-trained models: Voice Cloning text to speech (custom voice)
This speech synthesis model using BARK, Tortoise, and SVC pre-trained models can be used for voice cloning in text-to-speech. This model allows for the creation of custom voices by leveraging the BARK model's speaker embeddings to capture unique vocal characteristics. The Tortoise model is integrated to convert text inputs into high-quality speech using these embeddings, resulting in natural-sounding speech that closely resembles the target speaker. The SVC model ensures the authenticity and fidelity of the cloned voice by verifying the alignment of the input audio with the identified speaker's characteristics. Throughout the development process, I fine-tuned the models and curated appropriate training datasets to achieve optimal performance. The deliverables include the pre-trained models (BARK, Tortoise, and SVC), associated weights and configurations, as well as detailed instructions and code samples for seamless integration. It's important to adhere to ethical considerations and legal requirements when using cloned voice capabilities.
